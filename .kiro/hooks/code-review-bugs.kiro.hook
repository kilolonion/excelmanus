Focus on:\n1. Logic errors and incorrect behavior\n2. Edge cases that aren't handled\n3. Null/undefined reference issues\n4. Race conditions or concurrency issues\n5. Security vulnerabilities\n6. Improper resource management or resource leaks\n7. API contract violations\n8. Incorrect caching behavior, including cache staleness issues, cache key-related bugs, incorrect cache invalidation, and ineffective caching\n9. Violations of existing code patterns or conventions\nMake sure to:\n1. If exploring the codebase, call multiple tools in parallel for increased efficiency. Do not spend too much time exploring.\n2. If you find any pre-existing bugs in the code, you should also report those since it's important for us to maintain general code quality for the user.\n3. Do NOT report issues that are speculative or low-confidence. All your conclusions should be based on a complete understanding of the codebase.\n4. Remember that if you were given a specific git commit, it may not be checked out and local code states may be different."
