I need to create a formula that retrieves a commission rate based on multiple criteria which include a salesperson, type of sale, and a date that falls within a specified date range. While I can use the INDEX/MATCH function successfully for exact matches on the salesperson and type of sale, I'm struggling with incorporating the date range check into the formula. Specifically, I need to match a date against a range of start and end dates on another tab to confirm it falls within the range and then return the corresponding rate. How can I modify my formula to work with this date range criterion? Returning a \"1\" in the index if the date falls within those bounds. Once I have this last part figured out, the formula should work properly.",
