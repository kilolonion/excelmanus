How can I efficiently count the quantity of each item from a table that sometimes contains over ten thousand rows of data? I have previously used the subtotal formula, but it is time-consuming, especially when dealing with over a hundred items.The answer should be put from I3 with the Headers \"ITEM\" (from column B) and \"Qty\" (count). Sort the \"ITEM\" column from first to last in the order: A006, A004, A005 and calculate the corresponding count in the adjacent columns.
