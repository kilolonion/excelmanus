Can the provided code handle deleting the rows without taking excessive amounts of time?",

I want to create a macro or transpose data similar to how I manually transposed data from Column A to Column C onwards. The data I've shown is a trimmed version, whereas the actual file is much longer. However, when I tried the macro provided by a forum user, it resulted in a 'run time error 7 out of memory'. After an adjustment was suggested to the macro code, it worked correctly.",

How can I match and replace the values in Sheet1 and Sheet2 with those in the ITEMS sheet based on column B? Specifically, if the value in cell B2 of Sheet1 or Sheet2 does not match the value in cell B2 of the ITEMS sheet, then B2 in Sheet1 or Sheet2 should be replaced with the corresponding value from the ITEMS sheet. This comparison and replacement should be done for each cell in column B. After the replacement, column B in both Sheet1 and Sheet2 should match column B in the ITEMS sheet - the outcome I'm expecting are detailed in 'result sheet1' and 'result sheet2'.
