How can I add a period to a cell in Excel if there is a middle initial present, and leave it blank if there is no middle initial? The middle initial is obtained from the full name in cell E19 with first name in E5 and last name in E7. The extraction formula I'm using for the middle name is `=TRIM(MID(E19,LEN(E5)+1,LEN(E19)-LEN(E5&E7)))`, which gives the middle name in E9. Then I'm converting it to proper case with `=PROPER(E9)` in F10, and I'm taking the initial from that result with `=LEFT(F10)` in F7. If F7 contains an initial, I want to add a period after it. Otherwise, F7 should remain blank. Every formula I've tried results in a `#VALUE` error. What formula should I use to achieve this?",

How do I identify which 'cat' and which 'dog' have the associated first and second largest numbers, and display these rankings in row 4? I encountered a problem when trying to search for the largest number associated with 'dog' if the largest number in the row is associated with 'cat', using a formula that involves an IF and AND statement. I have tried using a combination if(and statement that looks for \"dog\" and then looks for Large(A2:H2,1), but if \"cat\" has the largest number, then looking for \"dog\" with the largest number across the row fails. Any help appreciated.dog1 = largest # dog\ndog2 = 2nd largest # dog",
